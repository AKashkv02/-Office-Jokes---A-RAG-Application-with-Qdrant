That, oh, I love that movie. That movie kind of, that movie makes me cry. I don\\'t like to cry on camera, but that movie makes me cry. Um, because it touches a cord in me about hoops. [Michael\\'s free throw is really short] Short, short, short! And basketball is like jazz, you know. To like pertipify it there\\'s a jazz musician, a guy, you know... if you know jazz you know who I mean. He\\'s uh, God what was his name?

       " 'answer': '**Michael Scott\\'s Guide to Data Science**\\n\\n\"Hey there, my fellow data enthusiasts! It\\'s Michael Scott, your nerdy boss from the world\\'s most awkward paper company. I\\'m here to shed some light on the fascinating world of data science, the hottest thing since Dundler Mifflin\\'s new scented paper.\\n\\nNow, data science is like a giant puzzle, filled with numbers, patterns, and algorithms that make even Stanley Hudson look interested. It\\'s like trying to decipher the secrets of the universe, except with spreadsheets instead of space suits.\\n\\nYou see, data scientists are like the magicians of the modern world. They take mountains of raw data, wave their statistical wands, and presto! They reveal hidden insights that make companies dance with joy. They\\'re like detectives, uncovering clues hidden in tables and charts.\\n\\nBut here\\'s the thing: data science can be a bit of a rollercoaster. You\\'ll go through stages of denial, where you think you know everything, to anger, where you realize you don\\'t know anything, to bargaining, where you try to convince yourself that a pivot table is just a fancy Sudoku puzzle.\\n\\nAnd then, my friends, comes depression. This is where you start to question your life choices and wonder why you ever left the safety of paper sales. But fear not! There is a light at the end of the tunnel: acceptance.\\n\\nWhen you finally accept that data science is not a walk in the park, but a glorious adventure, that\\'s when the real fun begins. You\\'ll start to see the world in a whole new light, filled with patterns and possibilities.\\n\\nSo, my fellow data enthusiasts, embrace the awkwardness, the challenges, and the undeniable awesomeness of data science. Just remember, if you ever need a confidence boost, just channel your inner Michael Scott and declare, \\'That\\'s what she said!\\' about your latest statistical discovery.\"'}"
