# -Office-Jokes---A-RAG-Application-with-Qdrant
# Description:

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using the Qdrant vector database. It utilizes a dataset of "The Office" dialogues to train an LLM to generate jokes and text in the style of the show's characters. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an AI framework for improving the quality of LLM-generated responses by grounding the model on external sources of knowledge to supplement the LLM’s internal representation of information.

"The Office" is renowned for its quirky characters, hilarious dialogues, and memorable jokes. This project leverages advanced technologies to capture the essence of the show's humor and generate new content that mimics the style of the characters.

**Key Features**:

**Langchain**:LangChain is an open source framework that lets software developers working with artificial intelligence (AI) and its machine learning subset combine large language models with other external components to develop LLM-powered applications. The goal of LangChain is to link powerful LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to an array of external data sources to create and reap the benefits of natural language processing (NLP) applications.

**Qdrant Cloud**: Qdrant's hosted cloud service is utilized for configuring a free cluster and deploying the vector database to the cloud. Qdrant provides powerful features for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings. Qdrant is a vector database & vector similarity search engine

**RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a natural language processing (NLP) technique that combines generative- and retrieval-based artificial intelligence (AI) models to improve the output of large language models (LLMs). RAG uses external data sources, like knowledge bases, to generate responses that reference an authoritative source outside of the LLM's training data sources. This can lead to more accurate AI responses that are also context-aware and human-like.

**Gemini Pro API**: This API unlocks the capabilities of Google's advanced large language model (LLM), Gemini Pro. It empowers the project to generate creative text formats and manipulate language in innovative ways.
